3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

   - I have created a GitHub Account With necessary repos for the PLP Journey. My Username is : 18Junior

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

  - I have installed Python, Java, and JavaScript on my machine. 

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

   - The numpy, matplotlib, and pandas have been installed.

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

   - I have downloaded and installed mySQL and configured it to meet the needs of the learning process.

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

   - Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization
Consider using virtualization tools such as Docker or virtual machines to:
*  Isolate project dependencies
* Ensure consistent environments across different machines

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

   - Explore extensions, plugins, and add-ons available for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, including:

* Syntax highlighting
* Linting
* Code formatting
* Version control integration

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process.

    -  Tools and Software Installed:
* Python3
* VSCode v1.73.1
* Git Bash v2.34.1

VSCode Extensions:
Installed essential extensions such as:
